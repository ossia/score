      <description>
        <p>ossia score 3.4.0 is a feature-packed release for the start of 2025.</p>
        <p>New features</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduce initial alpha support for loading AI models through onnxruntime. Right now supported models are BlazePose, YOLOv7 (blob detection), YOLOv8 (pose), ResNet. More to come, please mention any model you'd be interested in on our Discord! Feat. a cute new icon by @aklevy!</li>
          <li>Introduce initial support for MIDI control surfaces using the MCU protocol. Selecting a process will now make its parameters available over the control surface UI.</li>
          <li>Introduce Array Combiner, Array Tool, Array Flattener, and Array Recombiner processes to efficiently process arrays in various ways.</li>
          <li>Add a new 2D Point View visualizer to visualize arrays of 2D positions.</li>
          <li>Add an initial implementation for 2D and 3D DBAP spatialization algorithm. Note that the implementation just generates the coefficients, and thus can be applied to any kind of spatial content, not just audio data.</li>
          <li>Arraygen / Arraymap now provide an `n` variable to get access to the current number of elements.</li>
          <li>Improve on-line help integration. Hitting F1 on any process will now open a browser with the help page of said object.</li>
          <li>Integrate on-line help with Faust, VST and LV2 help page if available.</li>
          <li>LED View now supports displaying input array as a lightness array.</li>
          <li>Lightness Computer now supports RGBW output to facilitate use with this kind of LED strip.</li>
          <li>LV2: add a locally-built Suil for showing LV2 UIs as the latest release does not yet support Qt 6.</li>
          <li>macOS: more video format support.</li>
          <li>macOS: port away from PortAudio to MiniAudio for audio backend. This finally allows to select a different input and output device and overall looks much more stable all while being much easier to integrate.</li>
          <li>Patternist: add support for Accent and Slide features to enable sick acid bassline patterns.</li>
          <li>Patternist: add TB-3 (303-like) patterns to the pattern library (jcelerier/drum-patterns on GitHub).</li>
          <li>Patternist: add patterns from "260 Drum Machine Patterns" (René-Pierre Bardet) to the pattern library (thanks @danielmroczek.</li>
          <li>Threedim addon moved into official score repo to track changes more easily.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Bugfixes and improvements</p>
