Features:


- drag'n drop: insert between node ? Is it feasible with Qt5 ?

- context menu on header of tree view should list columns in the same order that they are visualized ?



------------------

Code:

- Not sure the "delete m_cmdQ->command(0);" works (in NetworkTreeModel.cpp)
  It seems that we can not delete a QCommand once it has been pushed on a QUndoStack !?
  If it is the case, doce for DeviceExplorer*Commands & DeviceExplorerModel.cpp could be simplified : no need for setCachedResult().


- For now, no notion of Device/Address in NetworkTree, just Node !
  Use i-score/API  

- NetworkTree*Command : some commands have the same data.
  Thus we should factorize some code !
