    cd score
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Some useful and easy potential contributions are listed [on the website](https://ossia.io/contributor-guide.html).

There are also many fixable areas in the code :
* [**TODO**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=TODO) : for simple issues.
* [**FIXME**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=FIXME) : for critical bugs / problems.
* [**MOVEME**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is not where it should be.
* [**REMOVEME**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is redundant.
* [**RENAMEME**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=RENAMEME) : when the class does not match with the file it's in.
* [**OPTIMIZEME**](https://github.com/ossia/score/search?q=OPTIMIZEME) : when an easy-to-write-but-suboptimal algorithm is used.

Finally, one can write its own score plug-ins to add custom features to the software.
An example plug-in with the most common classes reimplemented is provided [here](https://github.com/ossia/score-addon-tutorial).
